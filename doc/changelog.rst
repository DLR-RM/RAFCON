0.8.1
"""""
  
- Features:

  - renaming of module paths: core instead of state machine; gui instead of mvc
  - writing wrong data types into the outputs of the "execute" function produces an error now
  - Use external source editor: A button next to the source editor allows to open your code in an external editor, which you can configure
  - Gaphas: When resizing states, grid lines are shown helping states to bea aligned to each other (as when moving states)

- Improvements:

  - Gaphas: Change drawing order of state elements. Transitions are now drawn above states, Names of states are drawn
    beneath everything. This should ease the manipulation of transitions.
  - Gaphas: States are easier to resize, as the corresponding handle is easier to grab
  - states are now saved in folder that are named after: state.name + $ + state.state_id

- API:

  - library paths can now be defined relative to the config file (this was possible before, but only if the path was prepended with "./"

- Documentation:

  - started creation of "Developer's Guide"
  - moved ``odt`` document about commit guidelines into ``rst`` file for "Developer's Guide"

- Fixes:

  - :issue_ghe:`5`: Fix connection bug

  - :issue_ghe:`224`: Switch to respective state when trying to open a state which is already open.

- Refactoring:

  - Widgets have TreeViews not have a common base class. This allowed to get rid of a lot of duplicate code and made some implementations more robust
  - the code behind connection creation and modification in the Gaphas editor has been completely rewritten and made more robust
