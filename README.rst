Develop your robotic tasks using an intuitive graphical user interface
----------------------------------------------------------------------

RAFCON uses hierarchical state machines, featuring concurrent state execution, to represent robot programs.
It ships with a graphical user interface supporting the creation of state machines and
contains IDE like debugging mechanisms. Alternatively, state machines can programmatically be generated
using RAFCON's API.

Universal application

  RAFCON is written in Python, can be extended with plugins and is hard- and middleware independent.

Visual programming

  The sophisticated graphical editor can be used for the creation, execution and debugging of state machines.

Collaborative working

  Share and reuse your state machines in form of libraries, stored as JSON strings in text files.

Installation preparations
-------------------------

Before installing RAFCON, Python >=2.7, pip and setuptools are required on your system. Most of the other dependencies
are automatically resolved by pip/setuptools, but not all of them. Those need be be installed manually, too:

Installation requirements for Ubuntu 16.04
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    # rafcon needs gtk > 3.20; the easiest way to install it is installing gnome3
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt dist-upgrade

    # restart system

    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip libcairo2-dev gir1.2-gtksource-3.0 python-gi-cairo
    sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
    sudo -H pip install --upgrade setuptools

Installation requirements for Ubuntu 18.04
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip build-essential glade python-gi-cairo
   sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
   sudo -H pip install --upgrade setuptools

General requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are not using Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, please make sure that the following packages are installed:

* Python >=2.7
* pip (recent version required: v18 known to be working)
* python-setuptools (recent version required: v40 known to be working)


Installing RAFCON
-----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install rafcon --user

The ``--user`` flag is optional. If not set, RAFCON is installed globally (in this case you normaly need to have root privileges).

If during the installation the error ``ImportError: No module named cairo`` occurs, please install pycairo directly
via:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --user "pycairo<2.0.0,>=1.10.0"

If you are using Python 3.4, you will need a ``pip`` version <= 8. Run the following command, to downgrade ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --user --upgrade pip==8

Of course you can also directly use the RAFCON sources from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /install/directory
   git clone https://github.com/DLR-RM/RAFCON rafcon


Start RAFCON
------------

No matter which installation option you choose, RAFCON can be started from any location using (make sure
``/usr/local/bin`` or ``~/.local/bin`` is in your ``PATH`` environment variable):

.. code-block:: bash

   rafcon


Uninstallation
--------------

If you want to uninstall RAFCON, all you need to do is call

.. code-block:: bash

   pip uninstall rafcon
