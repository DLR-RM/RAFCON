# Contributing to RAFCON

Everybody is encouraged to contribute to the RAFCON project. However, collaboration needs some guidelines.

For instructions on how to contribute, see our [development guidelines](https://rafcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/development.html).

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](https://rafcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/development.html#code-of-conduct), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

In order to be able to change the license of RAFCON to another open source license, we need you to sign our CLA when contributing to RAFCON, either by you as [individual](./CLA_individuals.rst) or by your [organisation/company](./CLA_entities.rst).
