        Note: In the backward execution case the decider state does not have to be backward executed, as it only
        decides the outcome of the barrier concurrency state. In a backward execution the logic flow obviously already
        exists.

        The order of history items for the concurrency state is:
        Call - Concurrency - Return
        and for the backward case:
        Return - Concurrency - Call

        In the forward case:
        - Call: Before calling the child
        - Return: After executing the child
        In the backward case:
        - Pop Return: Before backward executing the child
        - Pop Call: After backward executing the child

        The decider state is not considered in the backward execution case.
